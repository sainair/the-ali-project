# THE ALI PROJECT
A project made for fun to mess with a friend while learning the sfml library. This is my first ever gui app so expect bugs!!

To install on Arch:

```(sudo) pacman -S sfml```

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```(sudo) apt install libsfml-dev```

```git clone https://github.com/idkwhattonamethislol/the-ali-project```

Then start the building process:

Then run the app by opening it from src/bin:
